# React-SpringBoot Library Application



## Overview

The React-SpringBoot Library Application is a full-stack JavaScript application built with React and Spring Boot. This project serves as a starting point for developing modern web applications that require both a dynamic front-end and a robust back-end. It combines the power of React for interactive user interfaces and Spring Boot for building scalable RESTful APIs.

## Features

- **React Front-End:**
  - User-friendly UI with responsive design.
  - State management using React's built-in features.
  - React Router for client-side routing.
  
- **Spring Boot Back-End:**
  - RESTful API development with Spring Web.
  - Secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  - Database integration via Spring Data JPA.
  
- **Integration:**
  - Seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.
  - A well-structured project layout for easy maintenance.
